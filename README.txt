All java files need to be compiled. To run the program, run Main. The program will 
prompt the user to input the database username and password, furniture (chair, lamp etc.), 
type, and quantity one at a time in that order. Furniture and type are both case insensitive; also 
the program will not account for any leading or trailing whitespaces in the user entries.

Please note that the terminal will continue to prompt the user until all inputs are valid.
This includes valid furniture, type and quantity. While prompting the program will try to 
interact and assist the user by displaying the valid entries, whenever the user made an 
incorrect input.

Make sure to include the mySQL-connector, JUnit, and hamcrest jar files in your command 
when compiling and running the program; these jar files are stored inside the lib folder.

The unit tests should be compiled and run, and the database should match the one 
created by the most recent inventory.sql file on D2L. 

Please note there were some edits made to the output text file for consistency after the video was filmed.
